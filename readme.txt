About
-----

Wii RetroPad Adapter is a Wiimote adapter based on a small PCB, an ATMega uC 
and a couple of connectors that allow you to use the following classic
joysticks as if they were a Wii Classic Controller:

:. Sega Genesis pad(also supports: Sega Master System, Atari 2600 and others)

:. Nintendo NES pad

:. Super NES pad 

:. Playstation digital pads and Playstation 2 pads

:. Game Cube pad

:. Nintendo 64 pad

The Wii RetroPad adapter talks to the Wiimote that, ultimately, talks to the
Wii wirelessly, so you get a real Classic Controller experience with no Game
Cube extension cables involved! :)

This adapter is compatible with both Nintendo official games and also homebrews
(AKA, those great emulators out there!).

Wii RetroPad Adapter 2.0 is released and now it comes with an enclosure, and 
not like a "barebones" PCB anymore! :)


How to get it
-------------

Wii RetroPad Adapter is Opensource / Open hardware, so you can construct your
PCB, compile the source code, burn the firmware in the micro-controller and
start using it. 

However, there are people who are not familiar with PCB manufacturing process
nor have the skills, or even time, to construct his/her own adapter. For those
people, you are invited to contact me at bootsector@ig.com.br so I can sell
you a ready-to-use adapter! :)

You will also be able to buy it from both http://www.brunofreitas.com/ or
http://www.faiscaefumaca.com.br/
